## Topics Covered in CT5

| Topic | Items |
|---|---|
| Pointers and arrays | 4 |
| Treating pointers as arrays | 2 |

## Topics Covered in CT6 – Building a Simple Dynamic Array (Resize + Copy)

| Topic | Items |
|---|---|
| The `new` and `delete` operators (`shared_ptr` and `unique_ptr` allowed) | 1 |
| Two dimensional arrays | 1 |
| Dynamic arrays | 1 |

These deal with heap allocation and dynamic memory. `new`/`delete` is needed to build a dynamic array, and 2D arrays often involve dynamic allocation. The resize + copy activity is the context to introduce all three.
